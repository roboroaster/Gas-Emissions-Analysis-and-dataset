# Gas-Emissions-Analysis-and-dataset
this project aims to analyse and gives insights about the gas  emission scenario in various cities of the world and creates a dataset for the selected city.
<br>
<p>Currently it can produce the dataset for the 20 cities given in the coordinates dictionary in the jupyter notebook. <br>
emission dataset for any other city or a place can be created just by adding a key-value pair of the place name and it's coordinated and then use the df_compiler function.
it currently supports only the dataset creation part and EDA part will soon be added.</p>
<i>(Note: this project uses the emissions api(https://emissions-api.org/) in order to fetch the data and create it's dataset)</i>
